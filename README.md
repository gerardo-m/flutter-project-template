# flutter-project-template README

Template and snippets for a medium size applications. This project is still in *BETA*

I am building this extension to support my own Flutter project structure,
from creating the initial setup to some snippets for repetitive tasks I have encountered
across multiple projects.

I may explain the project structure I use in the future if someone find this
useful or just need a guide on how to approach Flutter projects.

## Commands

| Command            | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `FP: Setup`        | Initialize the application template |
| `FP: New Screen`   | Creates an empty screen             |

### Warning!!!

Only call the `FP: Setup` command when starting a new project, since it will overwrite your main.dart and pubspec.yaml files.

## Snippets

| Snippet            | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `fpsimpleroute`    | Creates a static method for route handling |

## Known Issues

None for the moment.
